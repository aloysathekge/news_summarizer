      "Hours after ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula warned of removing Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan if he does not perform, the ANC made a U-turn saying the minister was safe in his job.\n",

      "Mbalula, in a speech at the ANC Women's League conference in Johannesburg on Saturday, told delegates that the party expected performance from its deployees to the government.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"We need all the trucks off the road because people are dying because of these trucks. Trucks must get off the road, and goods be transported by rail. Let's not act like we are not in government. We are in charge,\" he said.\n",

The fact that a clarion call is sounded on the minister to fast-track policy interventions to address our rail and freight logistics does not amount to a call for his removal,\" the ANC said in a statement issued by spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri.\n",
